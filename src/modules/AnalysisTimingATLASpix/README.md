# AnalysisTimingATLASpix
**Maintainer**: Jens Kroeger (jens.kroeger@cern.ch)  
**Module Type**: *DUT*  
**Detector Type**: *ATLASpix*  
**Status**: work in progress

### Description
This module contains everything that's necessary for an in-depth timing analysis of the ATLASpix, including row and timewalk corrections.

Before being able to apply the row and timewalk correction, correction files need to be provided.
These can be generated by setting `calc_corrections=true`.
The calculation of the timewalk correction is based on a row-corrected histogram such that this procedure needs to be performed in 2 steps.

1. Calculated row correction.
2. Use row correction file and calculated timewalk correction.
After this both corrections can be applied on top of each other.

### Parameters
* `timing_cut`: Timing cut for associating a track with an ATLASpix cluster. Defaults to `1us`.
* `chi2ndof_cut`: Acceptance criterion for telescope tracks, defaults to a value of `3`.
* `time_cut_frame_edge`: Parameter to discard telescope tracks at the frame edges (start and end of the current frame). Defaults to `20ns`.
* `cluster_charge_cut`: Parameter to discard clusters with a charge larger than the cut. Defaults to `100000e` (inifitely large).
* `cluster_size_cut`: Parameter to discard clusters with a size too large, only for debugging purposes, default is 100 (inifitely large).
* `high_tot_cut`: Cut dividing 'low' and 'high' ToT events (based on seed pixel ToT). Defaults to `40`.
* `high_charge_cut`: Cut dividing 'low' and 'high' charge events (based on cluster charge). Defaults to `40e`.
* `left_tail_cut`: Cut to divide into left tail and main peak of time correlation histogram. Only used to investigate characteristics of left tail. Defaults to `-10ns`.
* `calc_corrections`: If `true`, TGraphErrors for row and timewalk corrections are produced.
* `correction_file_row`, `correction_file_timewalk`. Defaults to `false`.
* `correction_file_row`: Path to file which contains TGraphErrors for row correction. If this parameter is set, also `correction_graph_row` needs to be set. No default.
* `correction_file_timewalk`: Path to file which contains TGraphErrors for timewalk correction. If this parameter is set, also `correction_graph_timewalk` needs to be set. No default.
* `correction_graph_row`: Name of the TGraphErrors including its path in the root file used for row correction. E.g. "AnalysisTimingATLASpix/apx_0/gTimeCorrelationVsRow". No default.
* `correction_graph_timewalk`: Name of the TGraphErrors including its path in the root file used for row correction. E.g. "AnalysisTimingATLASpix/apx_0/gTimeCorrelationVsTot". No default.
